Hello Ko Ravel,
This is the program for week 3's assignment. I made an restaurant order system, where they will display the available food and their prices. And the user's job is to type in 
what they want to order. There are 2 available lists, which contain the food and its prices(Noodles, Pizza and Chicken each with different prices). For pizza, they will ask 
for the available toppings. For noodles, they will ask for the type of noodles that they want to order. I had made 2 seperate functions for them. each of the functions have,
one input function and a series of if and elif statements. The final output will print a statement of what you order with the price.

I hope this gives you an idea on how my coding skills is right now.

From, 
Jonathan Christopher Wenan
